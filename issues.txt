1. Physics Solver  

- Closing the tab on the browser for more than 1 sec makes the objects explode because of the delta_time variable from the Ticker becoming too big. 

- Can be fixed by listening for unload events and setting Ticker.time = 0; and the next time when the user opens it, setting the Ticker.time to 1 and setting dt to 0

2. Renderer 

- Renderer.dom element get's streched in the y axis when opened on any browser on Android.

3. Quadtree / Spatial tree insertion method must be made more efficient.

4. Objects get too fast if the big mass is moved too quickly, can be done by maybe clamping it's velocity. Using a global resistance can be a good option but then things won't orbit each other.
